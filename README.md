This is a basic graphical clock project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The clock is designed with separate elements for hours, minutes, and seconds, each linked to the JavaScript code for real-time updates. 
It's my first attempt at using these technologies, and I followed a YouTube tutorial to create it.
